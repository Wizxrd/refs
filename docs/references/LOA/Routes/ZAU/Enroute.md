# Enroute Crossing Requirements

## General Notes
- ZAU has control to change beacon codes subsequent to radar handoff and frequency change
- All “SID assigned” speeds must be deleted or amended via ATC clearance prior to entering ZAU airspace. All speed restrictions coordinated via the 4th line of the data block “ATC assigned.”
