## General

### Operational Positions
All controllers shall adhere to the following standard when signing onto a LBE position.

| Callsign | Position | Radio Name | ID | Frequency |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| LBE\_GND | Ground | Palmer Ground | GC | 121.800 |
| LBE\_TWR | Local | Palmer Tower | T | 125.000 |

**(CLE\_66 or any position overlying is to be used as a replacement for JST RAPCON).**

### Area of Responsibility

1. LBE surface area of responsibility is defined as a 5 NM radius around LBE from surface up to and including 3700ft MSL.

### Operational Hours

0615-2200L

### Required Facility Procedures

1. Runway Use Program  
   i. The calm wind runway for Arnold-Palmer Regional Airport is RWY24.  
   ii. Use the runway most nearly aligned with the wind when 5 knots or more or the “calm wind” runway when less than 5 knots unless use of another runway will be operationally advantageous or is requested by the pilot.

## Clearance Delivery / Ground
CD shall issue ATC clearances to IFR and VFR Class D departures as followed:

1. **IFR Departures:** 
      i.  Assign 5000ft   
      ii. Inform the aircraft to expect (requested altitude) 10 minutes after departure.  
2. **VFR Class D Departures:**   
      i. Determine destination/direction of flight and make note of requested altitude in flight strip.   
      ii. No initial altitude restrictions necessary unless otherwise coordinated.

### Ground Movement

1. GC must protect the intersection of taxiways A and B for all aircraft that may use these movement areas to exit active runways.

## Local Control

### Departure Procedures

1. LC shall coordinate with the appropriate radar sector (JST RAPCON or the appropriate replacement) for the release of all IFR departures.  
2. All VFR departures from LBE are automatically released.  
3. On departure, all IFR aircraft shall be assigned runway heading and 5000ft.  
4. The overlying controller may cancel any automatic release when necessary due to traffic.

### Arrival Procedures

1. LC shall ensure arriving IFR aircraft are separated from any VFR aircraft.

### Go Arounds and Missed Approaches

1. LC must advise the radar sector which will provide radar service to the aircraft executing a missed approach or go-around  
2. LC must assign the aircraft 5,000ft and may turn 20 degrees left or right of the centerline if required for separation, without coordination. The affected radar sector must be advised of this heading assignment prior to communication transfer.

### Helicopter Operations
All movement areas are authorized for helicopter operations. When conducting helicopter operations LC shall coordinate with GC prior to issuing arrival/departure instructions to/from any location on the field other than active runways.
