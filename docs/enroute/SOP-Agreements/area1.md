|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CAK, CLE, CLE Sats      | Arrivals         | 1, 2, 4, 8        | Aircraft must be assigned the BRWNZ arrival. Aircraft must not be cleared further direct than FRYYE. YQG sector may issue “descend via” clearance on contact. |
| CAK, CLE, CLE Sats      | Prop Arrivals    | 1, 2, 4, 58       | Props on the BRWNZ arrival must be descended and handed off to D21 so as not to enter YQG sector airspace. |
| DTW                     | Arrivals         | 1, 8              | KDTW arrivals must enter Area 1 on the correct route for the known flow, descending at pilot’s discretion to 17,000 feet, or lowest available altitude. The LFD sector has control, on contact, for issuing the “descend via” clearance, speed adjustments, left turns up to 30°, and right turns up to direct HANBL. |
| DTW Satellites          | Arrivals         | 1, 8              | Area 8 must deliver KDTW satellites to Area 1 on the PETTE STAR, descending to 14,000. LFD sector has control, on contact, for speed adjustments, left turns up to 30°, and right turns up to direct PETTE. |
| DTW, DTW Sats           | Jet Departures   | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 | The first ZOB sector to work a D21 jet departure must delete or amend, via ATC clearance, any “SID assigned” speed restriction. |
| DTW, DTW sats           | Departures       | 1                 | All D21 departures routed over the CCOBB departure fix must be capped at or below FL220. |
| FNT                     | Arrivals         | 1, 2, 4, 8        | Except for those aircraft that will transit D21, KFNT arrivals west of VWV must be routed via HAZIT VHICL CITYE and handed off to the LFD sector. KFNT arrivals east of VWV must be routed via MARGN KFNT. |
| GRR, BTL, AZO, SBN, BEH | Arrivals         | 1, 2              | GRR, BTL, AZO, SBN, or BEH arrivals must be descended to FL240 and handed off to Area 1. |
| MTC                     | Arrivals         | 1                 | KMTC arrivals may be routed through D21 via RRALF or PETTE STARs, or they may be routed "over the top" of D21. Aircraft taken "over the top" must be pointed out to D21 for a lower altitude. Note: All high performance tactical aircraft (departures and arrivals) will be worked by FNT or DRE sectors. |
| ORD                     | Arrivals         | 1, 2              | HUD/LAK sectors relinquish control to ECK for turns and speed control on KORD arrivals established on or north of Q436, providing the aircraft remain on or north of Q436. All speed adjustments must be entered in the 4th line. ECK assumes responsibility for separation with aircraft established on or north of Q436, routed into Area 1. |
